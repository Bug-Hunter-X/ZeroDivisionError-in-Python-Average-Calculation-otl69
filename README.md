This repository contains a Python code example demonstrating a common error: ZeroDivisionError. The original code calculates the average of a list of numbers but doesn't handle empty lists or lists containing only zeros, resulting in a division by zero error.  The solution demonstrates how to prevent this error by implementing checks for empty lists and lists containing only zeros. The code is straightforward and easy to understand.  The example shows how to add error handling to avoid unexpected crashes in your Python applications.
